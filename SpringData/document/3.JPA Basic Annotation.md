# JPA Basic Annotation

#### @Entity
`@Entity` annotation is Object unit matching one by one with Database table. .It means one record value at table.

When you don't write table name, the table name will be class name automatically. So recommended way is use underscore intentionally
because usually use under score at database.

~~~java
@Entity
public class Organization{
}

@Entity(name = "employee")
public class Student{
}

@Entity(name = "student_address")
public class StudentAddress{
}
~~~

#### @Column
`@Column` annotation match with column in table and you can omit when use as normal case.

But, when use column name as underscore, should write `name` attribute in annotation.

~~~java
@Column
private String code;

@Column(length = 100)   //limit length
private String name;
 
//Can omit @Column
private String description;

@Column(precision = 11, scale = 2)  //Can setting limit when use BigDecimal
private BigDecimal name;

@Column(name = "register_date")  //Can setting limit when use BigDecimal
private BigDecimal registerDate;
~~~

#### @Id
In Database, there is Primary key every table. JPA can designate which column is PK.

~~~java
@Id
@Column
private String code;
~~~

#### @GeneratedValue

PK Column data structure must be unique because for prevent `dead lock`, So use BigInteger as like `Long` in Java.

And can designate strategy type to fit each DBMS. 

- @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
- @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
- @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
- @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE)

~~~java
@Id 
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
~~~

#### @Transient

If some member value which don't use in Data base, should write `@Transient`.

~~~java
@Transient
private String no;
~~~

#### @Embeddable

If want to use class as column in some `Entity`, can use `@Embeddable`.

First, attach `@Embeddable` class which want as value another class.  
~~~java
@Embeddable
public class Address {

    private String street;

    private String city;

    private String state;

    private String zipCode;
}
~~~

Second, attach `@Embedded` in class which want has value from another class.   

~~~java
@Embedded
private Address address;
~~~

If want to use different name, can use as like below code.

~~~java
@Embedded
@AttributeOverrides({
        @AttributeOverride(name = "street", column = @Column(name = "home_street"))
})
private Address address;
~~~
