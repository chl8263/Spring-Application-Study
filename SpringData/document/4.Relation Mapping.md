# Relation Mapping

Relation Mapping is expression how to relation with other table. In JPA Table expression as class.

So there are a lot of way how to make up it.

All Relation has two entity.
- One is owning and another is non-owning 

### One-way
#### @ManyToOne
Default value is FK.

~~~java
@ManyToOne
private Account owner;
~~~

#### @OneToMany
Default value is to create Join table.

~~~java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
private Set<Study> studies = new HashSet<>();
~~~

### Bidirectional

- Owner that has `@ManyToOne` annotation.
- Non owner should set relation which field relation with this table using `mapprdBy`.
- You need to set up a relationship with field to reflect it in the DB.
